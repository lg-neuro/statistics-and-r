RAFAEL IRIZARRY: When data is not normally distributed, than the mean
and the standard deviation aren't necessarily good summaries.
An example of data that is not normally distributed are salaries.
So in our usingR library, we have a data set with the salaries of executives.
We can make that histogram just to get an idea
of what that distribution looks like.
And we can see it looks nothing like normal.
There's a lot of executives getting paid between 0 and 250.
And then there are some that are getting paid a lot more than that.
So if we make a qqnorm, we'll see immediately
that it does not follow a normal distribution, not even close.
We have what statisticians call a fat right tail--
there's points that are much, much larger
than expected, if the data were normally distributed.
So if we were going to describe this data set to someone,
we would not tell them the mean and the standard deviation,
because it would not really give you a good idea
of the distribution of the data.
So more generally, the boxplot which is a plot that
shows you five numbers and also outliers, which
we won't describe today, is a much better summary.
The boxplot, it's a very simple idea.
It shows you the median-- that's going to be this line here.
You see that the median is around 50, which is quite different from the mean.
Let's look at what they mean is.

And the median is about half of what the mean is.
So then we have the 25th percentile in here, and the 75th percentile.
So this box here is showing us where 50% of the data
is, where the middle half of the data is included in this range here.
Then, we have the range of the data.
However, the box plot implementation in R
has a way of defining what are called outliers.
And the help file describes it pretty in some detail.
You can look at that.
And you can see that there's some outliers here.
But in general, the boxplot is a very nice graphical way
of displaying some summaries about the data, basically these five numbers.
