# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key part of what we do when we analyze data. We start out every analysis with EDA to familiarize ourselves with the data. First, we want to check to see if some of the samples or experiments produce unusable data and take them out of the analysis. We also perform EDA at the end to check for nonsensical results. In fact, one should perform EDA all throughout the analysis. For example, before applying any of the techniques we have learned, we want to make sure the data are in agreement with the necessary assumptions. We will introduce some basic EDA tools such as histogram, the Q-Q plot, scatter plots, boxplot, stratification, log transforms, and several summary statistics.
